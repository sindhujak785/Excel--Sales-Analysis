## 📌 Business Questions Answered

As part of this Excel project, I analyzed data to answer several key business questions:

1. 🔝 **Top 10 Products by Net Sales Growth (2020–2021)**  
   → Identified products with the highest YoY sales growth percentage.

2. 📊 **Division-wise Report for 2020 & 2021**  
   → Showcased net sales and growth % across each division.

3. 📦 **Top 5 and Bottom 5 Products by Quantity Sold**  
   → Ranked products based on total quantity sold.

4. 🆕 **New Products Introduced in 2021**  
   → Detected new SKUs by filtering rows with 0% growth (not sold in 2020).

5. 🌍 **Top 5 Countries by Net Sales in 2021**  
   → Analyzed country-wise performance to find the top-performing markets.

These insights simulate real-world business scenarios where a data analyst helps decision-makers understand sales patterns, market expansion, and product performance.
